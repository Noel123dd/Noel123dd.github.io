            <p>For our midterm project, we had to make maps and write 100 story about it. I made cities, towns, and different landscapes. I named this kingdom "United Gelidary". To simply summarize my story, people (race) "Gelidarinies" had a civil war and made their kingdom "United Gelidary".</p></div>
