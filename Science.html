            <p>For my science midterm, I made poster about Jane Goodall. I wrote about her background, timeline, and some interesting facts. There were about 20 list of women scientists, and I chose Jane Goodall, because I knew her the most. To briefly go over her background, she was born on 1934 April third in Bournemouth, England.</p></div>

            <p>I made this magazine that explains about space for my project with Jayden.  I used the informations from the textbooks and wrote many things about the solar systems, moons, and eclipses. I got A+ on this, and I am really proud of it. Also, I was able to learn different things about space with this project, such as the moon phases.</p></div>
